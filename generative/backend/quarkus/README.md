# Quarkus — Topic Index

Use this topic when building reactive or imperative backends on Quarkus 3.x (Jakarta EE 10 baseline) targeting JVM or native builds. Select components below according to your feature stack; each rule file is modular and should be referenced individually from host RULES/GUIDES.

How to use this index
- Pick the components that match your service (Core, RESTEasy Reactive, Persistence, Messaging, Security, etc.).
- Combine with cross-cutting topics (Testing & Coverage, Secrets & Config, Observability) for complete guidance.
- When prompting AI, cite the specific rule file path to keep outputs aligned.
