# Testing & Coverage — Topic Index

Use this topic when you need to enforce repository-wide testing quality gates (coverage, verification tasks) that cross CI/CD and build tool boundaries.

How to use this index
- Select this topic when prompting AI to configure coverage or test-quality instrumentation for JVM or multi-language projects that rely on shared tooling.
- Start with the Jacoco rules below for JVM bytecode instrumentation, then layer topic-specific TDD or framework rules referenced from RULES.md.
